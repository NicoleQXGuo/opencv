•	Created a neural network-based segmentation model to extract ID cards from photos with complex backgrounds.

•	Applied OpenCV in Python to increase the brightness, highlight the borders, and transform images from 3-d to 2-d.

•	Applied ResNet-50 to predict the position of the portrait on the ID card to determine the relative position of an ID card.
